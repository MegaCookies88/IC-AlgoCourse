    "# Game Instructions:\n",
    "Congrats on making it this far into the lecture! You'll be playing an auction game now, where there will be alternating rounds of buying and selling. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before the game:\n",
    "Everyone in the room will **receive a unique integer value from 0 to 10, inclusive of 0 and 10**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The integer can be drawn from one of the following distributions with equal probability:\n",
    "- Discerete uniform distributions: Uniform(0,5), Uniform(5,10), Uniform(2,7), Uniform(3,6)\n",
    "- Binomial distributions: Binomial(n = 10, probability of success = 0.5), Binomial(n = 10, probability of success = 0.75)\n",
    "- This probability density (where $C$ is a normalization constant):\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    f_{pdf}(x) = C*(\\sin^2(50\\pi x/10) + 0.01) * \\exp(-50(x/10-0.5)^2), x\\in[0,10]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "- This probability density function (where $C$ is a normalization constant):\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    f_{pdf}(x) = C*(x/10)^{0.275}(\\arctan{(x/10)} + 2^{x/10}) + \\exp(1-21(x/10)), x\\in[0,10]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "- The distribution of the value of $Y_t=10*sigmoid(X_t)$ at time step $100$ of the following SDE (where sigmoid is the function $sigmoid(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$), $X_0=0$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "dX_t = (50-X_t+20\\sin(5X_t) + 10*1_{(X_t>80)})dt + (0.1 X_t (100 - X_t)\\sin(10 X_t))dW_t\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for any continuous distributions, we draw a decimal value between 0 and 10 based on the pdf and then round to the nearest integer for the final value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notation clarification: \n",
    "- $exp(x)=e^{x}$ the exponential function.\n",
    "- $1_{X_t>80}$ is a function that equals $1$ if $X_t>80$ and $0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** In case it wasn't clear, it'll be hard figuring out EV.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### During the game:\n",
    "We will alternate between rounds of buying and selling in an auction-like fashion. **The item being auctioned is valued at the sum modulo 500 of all participants' drawn values**. For instance, if the sum of everyone's values is $1200$, then the value is $200$. Note that this means your bids should be anywhere from 0 to 499. Any value outside of that range will be assumed to be the nearest boundary (i.e. if its more than 499 it'll be taken as 499 and less than 0 is taken as 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "How the rounds work: \n",
    "- During a **buying round**, everyone will get 10 seconds to place integer bids, which are prices they are willing to buy at. The people with the 10 highest bids receives 1 unit of the item.\n",
    "    - Example: I place a bid at $2$, and 10 other people place bids at $4$,$5$ and $6$. Then in this round, I receive nothing while the other 10 people will get 1 unit of the item each at their respective bid prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During a **selling round**, everyone will get 10 seconds to place integer asks, which are prices they are willing to sell at. The people with the 10 lowest asks gets to sell 1 unit of the item\n",
    "    - Example: I place an ask at $10$ and 10 other people place asks at $9$, $8$ and $7$. Then in this round, I sell nothing while the other 10 people will sell 1 unit of the item each at their respective ask prices.\n",
    "- The same price level, e.g. $4$, can have multiple people on it. If say there are 20 people who've placed a bid at $4$ and $4$ is the highest bid, then 10 people will be randomly selected from the 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "How your wealth/money evolves:\n",
    "- Whenever you successfully buy a unit, your wealth goes down by whatever price you set. E.g. if you set a bid at 10 and it was successful, then your wealth has reduced by 10.\n",
    "- Whenever you successfully sell a unit, your wealth goes up by whatever price you set. E.g. if you set an ask at 10 and it was successful, then your wealth has increased by 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this game will be to develop an algorithm to buy low during the buy rounds and sell high during the sell rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### End of the game:\n",
    "Whatever inventory is leftover at the end of the game will be evaluated at the actual sum of everyone's integers. For instance, if I bought during 3 of the buy rounds and sold in 10 of the sell rounds, then I am in total 7 units in the negative (i.e. short). If the sum value was $10$, then I have to subtract $7*10$ from the money/wealth I have now. If I was instead 7 units in the positive (i.e. long), then I have to add $7*10$ to the money/wealth I have now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prize:\n",
    "If you have the most wealth by the end of this game AND no one else has the same wealth as you AND you won the bid/ask in at least HALF the rounds, **you get distinction on your cert by default**. If no one meets the above, no one gets the prize."

    "# Code\n",
    "Each round consists of 10 units of time representing 10 seconds of total elapsed time, starting at time 1. Time 1 consists of the 1st second (0s to 1s), time 2 the 2nd second (1s to 2s), etc up until the 10th time unit which is the 10th second (9s to 10s). \n",
    "\n",
    "During each time unit, you can submit an order of what price you would like to bid/ask at, e.g. during time 1 you can choose to submit an order at price level 10 at 0.5 seconds. You can also choose to skip rounds entirely. These in between bids/asks are inconsequential, i.e. they are not what is executed. Time 10 is when you choose to make your final decision of where to place your bid/ask, if any at all. If you submitted an answer at some point during a round, the latest submission will be used in its place (if you fail to submit at a particular time unit). The market will then resolve (i.e. 10 people are chosen that round) using the values submitted at time 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of every time unit, i.e. at seconds 1,2,3...,9,10, you will receive snapshots of what everyone submitted for that round aggregated into an array of length 500 with indexing from 0 to 499. For example, if 10 people placed orders at price level 20, then ```array[20]``` will have $10$ in it. More generally, if $k$ people placed orders at price level $i$, then ```array[i]``` will have $k$ in it. Use this information to your advantage to infer what people believe the fair price to bid at will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have 5 minutes to write out your logic. After this, the game will start. You can continue working on your strategy's logic as the game goes on, and simply rerun the appropriate cell below so that your orders are submitted according to your new strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in order to specify that you don't want to submit anything, simply submit ```None```. **If at any point you submit values outside of the 0 to 499 range**, it will be treated as a ```None``` submission and you will not participate."
